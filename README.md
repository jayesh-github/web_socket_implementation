    # Socket.IO Flutter

This repo contains the example of using socket.io with Flutter using [socket_io_client](https://pub.dev/packages/socket_io_client) package.

## Important:
This repo might not contain the best code ever written for socket.io usage with Flutter but it's good enough to at least get started.
